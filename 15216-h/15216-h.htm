<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>AUTHORSHIP OF "HENRY VIII."</h3>

  <p>In returning to the question of the authorship of <i>Henry VIII.</i>,
  I am anxious to remove a misconception under which MR. SPEDDING appears
  to labour relative to the purport of a remark I made in my last
  communication to you (Vol. ii., p. 198.) on this subject. As we appear to
  be perfectly agreed as to the reasons for assigning a considerable
  portion of this play to Fletcher, and as upon this basis we have each
  worked out a result that so exactly coincides with the other, I conclude
  that MR. SPEDDING, as well as myself, has rested his theory solely on
  positive grounds; that is, that he imagines there is strong internal
  evidence in favour of all that he ascribes to this writer. It follows,
  therefore that the "third hand" which he thought he detected must be
  sought rather in what remained to Shakspeare, than in that which had been
  already taken from him. I never for an instant doubted that this was MR.
  SPEDDING's view; but the inequality which I supposed he had observed and
  accounted for in this way, I was disposed to refer to a mode of
  composition that must needs have been troublesome to Shakspeare. The fact
  is, that, with one or two exceptions, the scenes contributed by the
  latter are more <i>tamely</i> written than any but the earliest among his
  works; and these, different as they are, they recalled to my mind. But I
  have no doubt whatever that these scenes were all written about the same
  time; my feeling being, that after the opening Shakspeare ceased to feel
  any great interest in the work. Fletcher, on the other hand, would appear
  to have made a very great effort; and though some portions of the work I
  ascribe to him are tedious and overlaboured, no censure would weigh very
  strongly against the fact, that for more than two centuries they have
  been <i>applauded</i> as the work of Shakspeare.</p>

  <p>As to the circumstances under which <i>Henry VIII.</i> was composed,
  it is an exceedingly difficult question; and if I venture, on the present
  occasion, to give the impression upon my mind, I do so, reserving to
  myself the full right to change my opinion whenever I shall have acquired
  more knowledge of the subject, or, from any other motive, shall see fit
  to do it. I consider this case, then, as one of joint authorship; in
  point of time not much later than the <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, and in
  other respects similar to that play. If the conclusions of the article in
  the <i>Westminster Review</i>, to which MR. SPEDDING alludes, be
  accepted, the writer of the introductory notice to <i>Henry VIII.</i> in
  the <i>Illustrated Shakspeare</i>, published by Tyas, will recognise the
  "reverent disciple" whom he hints at, but does not name. In short, I
  think that <!-- Page 402 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page402"
  id="page402"></a>{402}</span> Fletcher was the pupil of Shakspeare; and
  this view, it appears to me, demands the serious attention of the
  biographer who next may study or speculate upon the great poet's
  life.</p>

  <p>I don't know that I can add anything to MR. SPEDDING'S able analysis
  of <i>Henry VIII.</i> There are certain <i>tricks</i> of expression he,
  no doubt, has observed that characterise Fletcher's style, and which
  abound in the play. It might be useful to make notes of these; and, at
  some future time, I may send you a selection. I now beg to send you the
  following extracts, made some time ago, showing the doubts entertained by
  previous writers on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Though it is very difficult to decide whether short pieces be genuine
  or spurious, yet I cannot restrain myself from expressing my suspicion
  that neither the prologue nor epilogue to this play is the work of
  Shakspeare. It appears to me very likely that they were supplied by the
  friendship or officiousness of Jonson, whose manner they will be
  <i>perhaps found exactly</i> to resemble."&mdash;<i>Johnson.</i></p>

  <p>"Play revived in 1613." "Prologue and epilogue added by Jonson or some
  other person."&mdash;<i>Malone.</i></p>

  <p>"I entirely agree with Dr. Johnson, that Ben Jonson wrote the prologue
  and epilogue to this play. Shakspeare had a little before assisted him in
  his <i>Sejanus</i>.... I think I now and then perceive his hand in the
  dialogue."&mdash;<i>Farmer.</i></p>

  <p>"That Jonson was the author of the prologue and epilogue to this play
  has been controverted by Mr. Gifford. That they were not the composition
  of Shakspeare himself is, I think, clear from internal
  evidence."&mdash;<i>Boswell.</i></p>

  <p>"I entirely agree with Dr. Johnson with respect to the time when these
  additional lines were inserted.... I suspect they were added in 1613,
  after Shakspeare had quitted the stage, by that hand which tampered with
  the other parts of the play so much as to have rendered the versification
  of it of a different colour from all the other plays of
  Shakspeare."&mdash;<i>Malone.</i></p>

  <p>"If the reviver of this play (or tamperer with it, as he is called by
  Mr. Malone) had so much influence over its numbers as to have entirely
  changed their texture, he must be supposed to have new-woven the
  substance of the whole piece; a fact almost
  incredible."&mdash;<i>Steevens.</i></p>

  <p>The double character of Wolsey drawn by Queen Katherine and her
  attendant, is a piece of vigorous writing of which any other author but
  Shakspeare might have been proud; and the celebrated farewell of the
  Cardinal, with his exhortation to Cromwell, only wants that quickening,
  that vital something which the poet could have breathed into it, to be
  truly and almost incomparably great.</p>

  <p>"Our own conviction is that Shakspeare wrote a portion only of this
  play.</p>

  <p>"It cannot for a moment be supposed that any alteration of
  Shakspeare's text would be necessary, or would be allowed; as little is
  it to be supposed that Shakspeare would commence a play in his
  old-accustomed, various, and unequalled verse, and finish it in the easy,
  but somewhat lax and familiar, though not inharmonious numbers of a
  reverent disciple."&mdash;<i>Tyas's Shakspeare</i>, vol. iii. p. 441.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>At the same time I made the following notes from Coleridge:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8">"Classification, 1802.</p>
      <p>3rd Epoch.  Henry VIII. Gelegenheitsgedicht.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8">Classification, 1819.</p>
      <p>3rd Epoch.  Henry VIII., a sort of historical masque, or show-play."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It (the historical drama) must likewise be poetical; that only, I
  mean, must be taken which is the permanent in our nature, which is
  common, and therefore deeply interesting to all ages."&mdash;<i>Lit.
  Rem.</i>, vol. ii. p.160.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>What is said in this last extract might be applied (as Coleridge, I
  feel no doubt, had he gone one step farther into the subject, would have
  applied it) to the Shakspearian drama generally; and tried by this test
  <i>Henry VIII.</i> must certainly be found wanting.</p>

  <p>Before I conclude I am anxious to make an observation with regard to
  the extract from Mr. Emerson's <i>Representative Men</i> (vol. ii. p.
  307.). The essay from which this is taken, I presume to be the same, in a
  printed form, as a lecture which I heard that gentleman deliver. With
  abundant powers to form a judgment for himself, I should say that his
  mind had never been directed to questions of this nature. Accident,
  perhaps, had drawn his attention to the style of <i>Henry VIII.</i>; but,
  with reference to the general subject, he had received implicitly and
  unquestioned the conclusions of authorities who have represented
  Shakspeare as the greatest borrower, plagiarist, and imitator that all
  time has brought forth. This, however, did not shake his faith in the
  poet's greatness; and to reconcile what to some would appear
  contradictory positions, he proposes the fact, I might say the truism,
  that the greatest man is not the most original, but the "most indebted"
  man. This, in the sense in which it is true, is saying no more than that
  the educated man is better than the savage; but, in the apologetic sense
  intended, it is equivalent to affirming that the greatest thief is the
  most respectable man. Confident in this morality, he assumes a previous
  play to Shakspeare's; but it appears to me that he relies too much upon
  the "cadence" of the lines: otherwise I could not account for his
  <i>selecting</i> as an "autograph" a scene that, to my mind, bears
  "unmistakeable traits" of Fletcher's hand, and that, by whomsoever
  written, is about the weakest in the whole play.</p>

  <p>It is a branch of the subject which I have not yet fully considered;
  but MR. SPEDDING will observe that the view I take does not interfere
  with the supposition that Fletcher revised the play, <!-- Page 403
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>{403}</span>
  with additions for its revival in 1613; a task for the performance of
  which he would probably have the consent of his early master.</p>

<h3>ON AUTHORS AND BOOKS, NO. IX.</h3>

  <p><i>Eustache Deschamps.</i> Except in the two centuries next after the
  conquest, contemporaneous French notices of early English writers seem to
  be of rather infrequent occurrence.</p>

  <p>On this account, and on other accounts, the ballad addressed to
  Geoffrey Chaucer by Eustache Deschamps deserves repetition. Its text
  requires to be established, in order that we may be aware of its real
  obscurities&mdash;for no future memoir of Chaucer can be considered as
  complete, without some reference to it.</p>

  <p>The best authorities on Eustache Deschamps are MM. Crapelet,
  Raynouard, and Paulin Paris. To M. Crapelet we are indebted for the
  publication of <i>Poésies morales et historiques d'Eustache
  Deschamps</i>; to M. Raynouard, for an able review of the volume in the
  <i>Journal des Savants</i>; and to M. Paulin Paris, for an account of the
  manuscript in which the numerous productions of the author are preserved.
  Of the author himself, the learned M. Paris thus writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"On pourroit surnommer Eustache Deschamps le Rutebeuf du
  XIV<sup>e</sup> siècle.&mdash;Ses oeuvres comprennent des épitres, des
  discours en prose, des jeux dramatiques, des ouvrages latins, des
  apologues, un grand poème moral, et un infinité de ballades et rondeaux
  pieux, bouffons, satiriques," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Two impressions of the ballad in question are before me; one, in the
  <i>Life of Geoffrey Chaucer by sir Harris Nicholas</i>, dated
  1843&mdash;and the other in a volume entitled <i>Geoffrey Chaucer, poète
  anglais du XIV<sup>e</sup> siècle. Analyses et Fragments par H.
  Gomont</i>, Paris, 1847.&mdash;I transcribe the ballad from the latter
  volume, as less accessible to English students:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Anglais=angles; Ouï des grans=Ovides grans; Virgiles=Aigles;
  d'Angela=dangels; sont=font; A ja=N'a pas; buvraige=ouvrage;
  rafrener=rafrecir; soif=soix; Qui men=Qu'en ma; En=Et."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>After such an exhibition of various readings, arising out of only two
  copies of the same manuscript, it is evident that a re-collation of it is
  very desirable, and I am sure the result would be thankfully received by
  the numerous admirers of Chaucer.</p>

  <p class="author">BOLTON CORNEY.</p>

  <p><i>Eustache Deschamps</i> (Vol. ii., p. 376.).&mdash;J.M.B. is
  desirous of learning some particulars of this French poet,
  contemporaneous with Chaucer. He will find a brief notice of him in the
  <i>Recueil de Chants Historiques Français, depuis le XIIème jusqu'au
  XVIIIème Siècle</i>, by Le Roux de Lincy (2 vols. Paris, 1841, Libraire
  de Charles Espelin). He is there described as,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Ecuyer et huissier d'armes des rois Charles V. et Charles VI., qui
  resta toujours fidèle à la maison de France;"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And the editor adds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Les &#339;uvres d'Eustache Deschamps contiennent pour l'histoire du
  XIVème siècle des renseignemens précieux; on peut y recueillir des faits
  politiques qui ne sont pas sans importance, mais on y trouve en plus
  grand nombre des détails précieux sur les m&#339;urs, les usages, et les
  coutumes de cette époque."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>His poems were published for the first time in one vol. 8vo., in 1832,
  by M. Crapelet, with this title: <!-- Page 404 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>{404}</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Poésies morales et historiques d'Eustache Deschamps, écuyer, huissier
  d'armes des rois Charles V. et Charles VI., chatelain de Fismes et bailli
  de Senlis."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As regards the "<i>genuineness</i>" of the poem cited, I am inclined,
  with J.M.B., to think that it admits of question, the orthography
  savouring more of the end of the fifteenth than of the close of the
  fourteenth century. I am sorry not to be able to explain the meaning of
  "<i>la langue Pandras</i>."</p>

<h3>NOTES ON THE SECOND EDITION OF MR. CUNNINGHAM'S HANDBOOK OF LONDON.</h3>

  <p>21. <i>New Tunbridge Wells, at Islington.</i>&mdash;This fashionable
  morning lounge of the nobility and gentry during the early part of the
  eighteenth century, is omitted by Mr. Cunningham. There is a capital view
  of it in Bickham's <i>Musical Entertainer</i>, 1737:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"These once beautiful tea-gardens (we remember them as such) were
  formerly in high repute. In 1733 their Royal Highnesses the Princesses
  Amelia and Caroline frequented them in the summer time for the purpose of
  drinking the waters. They have furnished a subject for pamphlets, poems,
  plays, songs, and medical treatises, by Ned Ward, George Colman the
  older, Bickham, Dr. Hugh Smith, &amp;c. Nothing now remains of them but
  the original chalybeate spring, which is still preserved in an obscure
  nook, amidst a poverty-stricken and squalid rookery of misery and
  vice."&mdash;George Daniel's <i>Merrie England in the Olden Time</i>,
  vol. i. p. 31.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>22. <i>London Spa</i> (from which Spa Fields derives its name) dates
  as far back as 1206. In the eighteenth century, it was a celebrated place
  of amusement. There is a curious view of "London Spaw" in a rare pamphlet
  entitled <i>May-Day, or, The Original of Garlands</i>. Printed for J.
  Roberts, 1720, 8vo.</p>

  <p>23. <i>Spring Gardens.</i>&mdash;Cox's Museum is described in the
  printed catalogue of 1774, as being in "Spring Gardens." In the same year
  a small volume was published containing <i>A Collection of various
  Extracts in Prose and Verse relative to Cox's Museum</i>.</p>

  <p>24. <i>The Pantheon in Spa Fields.</i>&mdash;This place of amusement
  was opened in 1770 for the sale of tea, coffee, wine, punch, &amp;c. It
  had an organ, and a spacious promenade and galleries. In 1780 it was
  converted into a lay-chapel by the Countess of Huntingdon, and is now
  known as <i>Northampton</i> or <i>Spa Fields Chapel</i>. Mr. Cunningham
  speaks of the burying-ground (originally the garden), but singularly
  enough omits to notice the chapel.</p>

  <p>25. <i>Baldwin's Gardens</i>, running between Leather Lane and Gray's
  Inn Lane, were, according to a stone which till lately was to have been
  seen against a corner house, bearing the arms of Queen Elizabeth, named
  after <i>Richard Baldwin</i>, one of the royal gardeners, who began
  building here in 1589.</p>

  <p>26. <i>Rathbone Place.</i>&mdash;In an old print (now before me) dated
  1722, this street is called "<i>Rawbone Place</i>." The Percy
  coffee-house is still in existence.</p>

  <p>27. <i>Surrey Institution, Blackfriars Road.</i>&mdash;This building
  was originally erected, and for some years appropriated to the
  <i>Leverian Museum</i>. This magnificent museum of natural history was
  founded by Sir Ashton Lever, who died in 1788. It was afterwards disposed
  of by way of lottery, and won by Mr. James Parkinson, who transferred it
  from Leicester Place to the Surrey side of Blackfriars bridge.</p>

  <p>28. <i>Schomberg House, Pall Mall</i>, (now, I believe, about to be
  pulled down), was once the residence of that celebrated "quack" Dr.
  Graham. Here, in 1783, he erected his <i>Temple of Health</i>. He
  afterwards removed to Panton Street, Haymarket, where he first exhibited
  his <i>Earth Bath</i>. I do not find any mention of Graham in Mr.
  Cunningham's book.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Laying a Ghost.</i>&mdash;Frequent mention is made of the laying of
  ghosts, and in many localities the tradition of such an event is extant.
  At Cumnor, Lady Dudley (Amy Robsart's) ghost is said to have been laid by
  nine Oxford parsons, and the tradition is still preserved by the
  villagers; but nowhere have I been able to ascertain what was the
  ceremony on such an occasion.</p>

  <p>Is anything known on the subject?</p>

  <p class="author">A.D.B.</p>

  <p>Abingdon, Nov. 1850.</p>

  <p><i>A Test of Witchcraft.</i>&mdash;Among the many tests applied for
  the discovery of witchcraft was the following. It is, I believe, a
  singular instance, and but little known to the public. It was resorted to
  as recently as 1759, and may be found in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
  of that year.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"One <i>Susannah Hannokes</i>, an elderly woman of Wingrove, near
  Ayleshbury, was accused by a neighbour for bewitching her spinning-wheel,
  so that she could not make it go round, and offered to make oath of it
  before a majistrate; on which the husband, to justify his wife, insisted
  upon her being tried by the Church Bible, and that the accuser should be
  present: accordingly she was conducted to the parish church, where she
  was stript of all her cloathes to her shift and undercoat, and weighed
  against the Bible; when, to the no small mortification of her accuser,
  she outweighed it, and was honorably acquitted of the charge."</p>

<h3>MINOR NOTES.</h3>

  <p><i>Quin's incoherent Story.</i>&mdash;The comic story of Sir Gammer
  Vans (Vol. ii., p. 280.) reminds me of an anecdote related of Quin, who
  is said to have betted Foote a wager that he would speak some nonsense
  which Foote could not repeat off-hand after him. Quin then produced the
  following string of incoherences:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"So she went into the garden to pick a cabbage leaf, to make an
  apple-pie of; and a she-bear, coming up the street, put her head into the
  shop, and said 'Do you sell any soap?' So she died, and he very
  imprudently married the barber; and the powder fell out of the
  counsellor's wig, and poor Mrs. Mackay's puddings were quite entirely
  spoilt; and there were present the Garnelies, and the Goblilies, and the
  Picninnies, and the Great Pangendrum himself, with the little round
  button at top, and they played at the ancient game of 'Catch who catch
  can,' till the gunpowder ran out of the heels of their boots."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">L.</p>

  <p><i>Touchstone's Dial.</i>&mdash;Mr. Knight, in a note on <i>As You
  Like It</i>, gives us the description of a dial presented to him by a
  friend who had picked it "out of a deal of old iron," and which he
  supposes to be such a one as the "fool i' the forest" drew from his poke,
  and looked on with lacklustre eye. It is very probable that this species
  of chronometer is still in common use in the sister kingdom; for my
  brother mentions to me that, when at school in Ireland some fifteen or
  sixteen years since, he had seen one of those "<i>ring-dials</i>" in the
  possession of one of his schoolfellows: and Mr. Carleton, in his amusing
  <i>Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry</i>, thus describes
  them:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The ring-dial was the hedge-schoolmaster's next best substitute for a
  watch. As it is possible that a great number of our readers may never
  have heard of&mdash;much less seen one, we shall in a word or two
  describe it&mdash;nothing indeed could be more simple. It was a bright
  brass ring, about three quarters of an inch broad, and two inches and a
  half in diameter. There was a small hole in it, which, when held opposite
  the sun, admitted the light against the inside of the ring behind. On
  this were marked the hours and the quarters, and the time was known by
  observing the hour or the quarter on which the slender ray, that came in
  from the hole in front, fell."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">J.M.B.</p>

  <p><i>America and Tartary.</i>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Un jésuite rencontra en Tartarie une femme huronne qu'il avoit connue
  au Canada: il conclut de cette étrange aventure, que le continent de
  l'Amérique se rapproche au nord-ouest du continent de l'Asie, et il
  devina ainsi l'existence du détroit qui, longtemps après, a fait la
  gloire de Bering et de Cook."&mdash;Chateaubriand, <i>Génie du
  Christianisme</i>, Partie 4., Livre 4., Chap. 1.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Yet, with all deference to the edifying letters of this missionary
  jesuit, it is difficult to make such distant ends meet. It almost
  requires a copula like that of the fool, who, to reconcile his lord's
  assertion that he had with a single bullet shot a deer in the ear and the
  hind foot, explained that the deer was scratching his ear at the time
  with his foot.</p>

  <p>Subjoined is one more <i>proof</i> of the communication which once
  existed between America and the Old World:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Colomb disoit même avoir vu les restes des fourneaux de Salomon dans
  les mines de Cibao."&mdash;Chateaubriand, <i>Génie, Notes,

      <p class="i12"><i>Henry VI.</i>, pt. iii. Act v. Sc. 1.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is well known, and properly noted, that a pack of cards was
  formerly called a <i>deck</i>; but it should be added that the term is
  still commonly used in Ireland, and from being made use of in the famed
  song of "De Night before Larry was stretched,"</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>"De deck being called for dey play'd,</p>

  <p>it seems likely to be preserved. I may add, that many words and many
  forms of expression which have gone out of vogue in England, or have
  become provincial, are still in daily use in Ireland.</p>

  <p class="author">J.M.B.</p>

  <p><i>Time when Herodotus wrote.</i>&mdash;The following passage appears
  to me to afford strong evidence, not only that Herodotus did not complete
  his history till an advanced age, but that he did not <i>begin</i> it.
  For in lib. i. 5. he writes: "<span lang="el" title="ta de ep' emou ên megala, proteron ên smikra"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3B1; &#x3B4;&#x3B5; &#x3B5;&#x3C0;'

  &#x3C3;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>," "those cities, which
  in my time <i>were</i> great, were of old small." This is certainly such
  an expression as none but a man advanced in years could have used. It is
  perhaps worth observing, that this passage occurring in the Introduction
  does not diminish its weight, as the events recorded in it, leading
  naturally into the history, could not well have been written afterwards.
  As I have never seen this passage noticed with this view. I shall be glad
  to see whether the argument which I have deduced from it appears a
  reasonable one to your classical readers.</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>

<h3>DRYDEN'S "ABSALOM AND ACHITOPHEL."</h3>

  <p>In my small library I have neither Malone's <i>Life of Dryden</i>, nor
  that of more recent date by Sir Walter Scott; and, possibly, either of
  those works would render my present Query needless. It relates to a copy
  of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i> now lying before me, which is a mere
  chap-book, printed on bad paper, in the most economical manner, and
  obviously intended to be sold at a very reasonable rate: indeed, at the
  bottom of the title-page, which is dated "1708," we are told that it was
  "Printed and sold by H. Hills, in Black-fryars, near the Water-side,
  <i>for the Benefit of the Poor</i>." It consists of twenty-four pages,
  small 8vo., and, in order that the poem should not occupy too much space,
  one of the pages (p. 22.) is in a smaller type, and in double columns. At
  the end is the following singular</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">"ADVERTISEMENT.</p>

  <p>"To prevent the publicks being impos'd on, this is to give notice that
  the book lately published in 4to. is very imperfect and uncorrect, in so
  much that above thirty lines are omitted in several places, and many
  gross errors committed, which pervert the sense."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The above is in Italic type, and the body of the tract consists of
  only the first part of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, as ordinarily
  printed: allowing for misprints (which are tolerably numerous), the poem
  stands very much the same as in several common editions I have at hand.
  My Query is, Is the work known to have been so published "for the benefit
  of the poor," and in order to give it greater circulation, and what is
  the explanation of the "Advertisement?"</p>

  <p class="author">THE HERMIT OF HOLYPORT.</p>

  or in any future year: for instance, till of late it was open to a Roman
  Catholic to believe or not, as he might see reason, the fanciful notion
  of the immaculate conception of the Blessed Virgin; but the present
  Bishop of Rome has seen fit to make it an article of their faith; and no
  member of his church can henceforth question it without denying the
  infallibility of his spiritual sovereign, and so hazarding, as it is
  asserted, his own salvation."</p>

  <p><i>Sitting cross-legged.</i>&mdash;In an alliterative poem on Fortune

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The third line seems to illustrate those early illuminations in which
  kings and great personages are represented as sitting cross-legged. There
  are numerous examples of the A.-S. period. Was it <!-- Page 408 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>{408}</span> merely
  assumption of dignity, or was it not rather intended to ward off any evil
  influence which might affect the king whilst sitting, in his state? That
  this was a consideration of weight we learn from the passage in Bede, in
  which Ethelbert is described as receiving Augustine in the open air:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Post dies ergo venit ad insulam rex, et residens sub divo jussit
  Augustinum cum sociis ad suum ibidem adveire colloquium; caverat enim ne
  in aliquam domum ad se introirent, vetere usus augurio, ne superventu
  suo, si quid maleficæ artis habuissent, eum superando
  deciperent."&mdash;<i>Hist. Eccles.</i>, l. i. c. 25.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It was cross-legged that Lucina was sitting before the floor of
  Alemena when she was deceived by Galanthes. In Devonshire there is still
  a saying which recommends "sitting cross-legged to help persons on a
  journey;" and it is employed as a charm by schoolboys in order to avert
  punishment. (Ellis's <i>Brand</i>, iii. 258.) Were not the cross-legged
  effigies, formerly considered to be those of Crusaders, so arranged with
  an idea of the mysterious virtue of the position?</p>

  <p><i>Twickenham&mdash;Did Elizabeth visit Bacon there?</i>&mdash;I
  believe all the authors who within the last sixty years have written on
  the history of Twickenham, Middlesex (and among the most known of these I
  may mention Lysons, Ironside, and John Norris Brewer), have, when
  mentioning Twickenham Park, formerly the seat of Lord Bacon, stated that
  he there entertained Queen Elizabeth. Of this circumstance I find no
  account in the works of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. His
  lordship entertained her at Gorhambury in one of her progresses; and I
  would ask if it be possible that Twickenham may have been mistaken for
  his other seat of Gorhambury? It is well known Queen Elizabeth passed
  much of the latter part of her life at Richmond, and ended her days
  there; and in Mr. Nares' <i>Memoirs of Lord Burghley</i> there is an
  account of her visit to Barn-Elms; and there is also a curious
  description of her visit to Kew (in that neighbourhood) in the <i>Sydney
  Papers</i>, published by Arthur Collins, in two vols. folio, vol. i. p.
  376., in a letter from Rowland Whyte, Esq. Had Lord Bacon received her
  majesty, it must most probably have been in 1595. But perhaps some of
  your readers may be able to supply me with information on this
  subject.</p>

  <p><i>Burial towards the West.</i>&mdash;The usual posture of the dead is
  with the feet eastward, and the head towards the west: the fitting
  attitude of men who look for their Lord, "whose name is The East," and
  who will come to judgement in the regions of the dawn suddenly. But it
  was the ancient usage of the Church that the martyr, the bishop, the
  saint, and even the priest, should occupy in their sepulture a position
  the reverse of the secular dead, and lie down with their feet westward,
  and their heads to the rising sun. The position of the crozier and the
  cross on ancient sepulchres of the clergy record and reveal this fact.
  The doctrine suggested by such a burial was, that these mighty men which
  were of old would be honoured with a first resurrection, and as their
  Master came on from the east, they were to arise and to follow the Lamb
  as He went; insomuch that they, with Him, would advance to the Judgement
  of the general multitudes,&mdash;the ancients and the saints which were
  worthy to judge and reign. Now, Sir, my purpose in this statement is to
  elicit, if I may, from your learned readers illustrations of this
  distinctive interment.</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>

<h3>THE BLACK ROOD OF SCOTLAND.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., p. 308.)</p>

  <p>I am not aware of any record in which mention of this relique occurs
  before the time of St. Margaret. It seems very probable that the
  venerated crucifix which was so termed was one of the treasures which
  descended with the crown of the Anglo-Saxon kings. When the princess
  Margaret, with her brother Edgar, the lawful heir to the throne of St.
  Edward the Confessor, fled into Scotland, after the victory of William,
  she carried this cross with her amongst her other treasures. Aelred of
  Rievaulx (ap. Twysd. 350.) gives a reason why it was so highly valued,
  and some description of the rood itself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Est autem crux illa longitudinem habens palmæ de auro purissimo
  mirabili opere fabricats, quæ in modum techæ clauditur et aperitur.
  Cernitur in ea quædarn Dominicæ crucis portio, (sicut sæpe multorum
  miraculorum argumento probatum est). Salvatoris nostri ymaginem habens de
  ebore densissime sculptam et aureis distinctionibus mirabiliter
  decoratam."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>St. Margaret appears to have destined it for the abbey which she and
  her royal husband, Malcolm III., founded at Dunfermline in honour of the
  Holy Trinity: and this cross seems to have engaged her last thoughts for
  her confessor relates that, when dying, she caused it to be brought to
  her, and that she embraced, and gazed steadfastly upon it, until her soul
  passed from time to eternity. Upon her death (16th Nov., 1093), the Black
  Rood was deposited upon the altar of Dunfermline Abbey, where St.
  Margaret was interred.</p>

  <p>The next mention of it that I have been enabled to make note of,
  occurs in 1292, in the Catalogue of Scottish Muniments which were
  received within the Castle of Edinburgh, in the presence of the Abbots of
  Dunfermline and Holy Rood, and the Commissioners of Edward I., on the
  23rd August in that year, and were conveyed to Berwick-upon-Tweed. Under
  the head</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Omnia ista inventa fuerunt in quadam cista in Dormitorio S. Crucis,
  et ibidem reposita prædictos Abbates et altos, sub ecrum sigillis."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>we find</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Unum scrinium argenteum deauratum, in quo reponitur crux quo vocatur
  <i>la blake rode</i>."&mdash;Robertson's <i>Index</i>, Introd. xiii.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It does not appear that any such fatality was ascribed to this relique
  as that which the Scots attributed to the possession of the famous stone
  on which their kings were crowned, or it might be conjectured that when
  Edward I. brought "the fatal seat" from Scone to Westminster, he brought
  the Black Rood of Scotland too. That amiable and pleasing historian, Miss
  Strickland, has stated that the English viewed the possession of this
  relique by the Scottish kings with jealousy; that it was seized upon by
  Edward I., but restored on the treaty of peace in 1327. This statement is
  erroneous; the rood having been mistaken for the stone, which, by the
  way, as your readers know, was never restored.</p>

  <p>We next find it in the possession of King David Bruce, who lost this
  treasured relique, with his own liberty, at the battle of Durham (18th
  Oct., 1346), and from that time the monks of Durham became its
  possessors. In the <i>Description of the Ancient Monuments, Rites, and
  Customs of the Abbey Church of Durham</i>, as they existed at the
  dissolution, which was written in 1593, and was published by Davies in
  1672, and subsequently by the Surtees Society, we find it described
  as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"A most faire roode or picture of our Saviour, in silver, called the
  Black Roode of Scotland, brought out of Holy Rood House, by King David
  Bruce ... with the picture of Our Lady on the one side of our Saviour,
  and St. John's on the other side, very richly wrought in silver, all
  three having crownes of pure beaten gold of goldsmith's work, with a
  device or rest to take them off or on."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The writer then describes the "fine wainscote work" to which this
  costly "rood and pictures" were fastened on a pillar at the east end of
  the southern aisle of the quire. And in a subsequent chapter (p. 21. of
  Surtees Soc. volume) we have an account of the cross miraculously
  received by David I. (whom the writer confounds with the King David Bruce
  captured at the battle of Durham, notwithstanding that his <i>Auntient
  Memorial</i> professes to be "collected forthe of the best antiquaries"),
  and in honour of which he founded Holy Rood Abbey in 1128 from which
  account it clearly appears that this cross was distinct from the Black
  Rood of Scotland. For the writer, after stating that this miraculous
  cross had been brought from Holy Rood House by the king, as a "most
  fortunate relique," says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"He lost <i>the said crosse</i>, which was taiken upon him, and many
  other most wourthie and excellent jewells ... which all weare offred up
  at the shryne of Saint Cuthbert, <i>together with the Blacke Rude of
  Scotland</i> (so termed), with Mary and John, maid of silver, being, as
  yt were, smoked all over, which was placed and sett up most exactlie in
  the pillar next St. Cuthbert's shrine," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the description written in 1593, as printed, the size of the Black
  Rood is not mentioned; but in Sanderson's <i>Antiquities of Durham</i>,
  in which he follows that description, but with many variations and
  omissions, he says (p. 22.), in mentioning the Black Rood of Scotland,
  with the images, as above described,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Which rood and pictures were all three very richly wrought in silver,
  and were all smoked blacke over, <!-- Page 410 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>{410}</span> being
  large pictures of a yard or five quarters long, and on every one of their
  leads a crown of pure beaten gold," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have one more (too brief) notice of this famous rood. It occurs in
  the list of reliques preserved in the Feretory of St. Cuthhert, under the
  care of the shrine-keeper, which was drawn up in 1383 by Richard de
  Sedbrok, and is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"A black crosse, called the <i>Black Rode of Scotland</i>."&mdash;MS.
  Dunelm., B. ii. 35.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Strange to say, Mr. Raine, in his <i>St. Cuthbert</i>, p. 108.,
  appears to confound the cross brought from Holy Rood House, and in honour
  of which it was founded, with the Black Rood of Scotland. He was misled,
  no doubt, by the statement in the passage above extracted from the
  <i>Ancient Monuments</i>, that this cross was brought out of Holy Rood
  House.</p>

  <p>I fear that the fact that it was formed of silver and gold, gives
  little reason to hope that this historical relique escaped destruction
  when it came into the hands of King Henry's church robbers. Its sanctity
  may, indeed, have induced the monks to send it with some other reliques
  to a place of refuge on the Continent, until the tyranny should be
  overpast; but there is not any tradition at Durham, that I am aware of,
  to throw light on the concluding Query of your correspondent P.A.F., as
  to "what became of the 'Holy Cross,' or 'Black Rood,' at the dissolution
  of Durham Priory?"</p>

  <p>That the Black Rood of Scotland, and the Cross of Holy Rood House were
  distinct, there can, I think, be no doubt. The cross mentioned by Aelred
  is not mentioned as the "Black Rood:" probably it acquired this
  designation after his time. But Fordoun, in the <i>Scoti-Chronicon</i>,
  Lord Hailes in his <i>Annals</i>, and other historians, have taken
  Aelred's account as referring to the Black Rood of Scotland. Whether it
  had been brought from Dunfermline to Edinburgh before Edward's campaign,
  and remained thenceforth deposited in Holy Rood Abbey, does not appear:
  but it is probable that a relique to which the sovereigns of Scotland
  attached so much veneration was kept at the latter place.</p>

  taking it for granted that he does so, I will enlighten him a little on
  the subject. The "original Mrs. Partington" was a respectable old lady,
  living, at Sidmouth in Devonshire; her cottage was on the beach, and
  during an awful storm (that, I think, of Nov. 1824, when some fifty or
  sixty ships were wrecked at Plymouth) the sea rose to such a height as
  every now and then to invade the old lady's place of domicile: in fact,
  almost every wave dashed in at the door. Mrs. Partington, with such help
  as she could command, with mops and brooms, as fast as the water entered
  the house, mopped it out again; until at length the waves had the
  mastery, and the dame was compelled to retire to an upper story of the
  house. I well recollect reading in the Devonshire newspapers of the time
  an account similar to the above: but the first allusion to the
  circumstance was, I think, made by Lord Brougham in his celebrated speech
  in the house of Commons on the Reform Bill, in which he compared the
  Conservative opposition to the bill to be like the opposition of "Dame
  Partington and her mop, who endeavoured to mop out the waves of the
  Atlantic."</p>

  <p><i>The East Anglian Word "Mauther"</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 217.
  365.).&mdash;Skinner's note on this word is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Mawther, vox Norfolciensi agro peculiaris: <i>Spelman</i> ipse eodem
  agro ortus a Dan. <i>Moer</i>, Virgo, Puella, deflectit. Possit tamen et
  declinari a Belg. <i>Maegd</i>, Teut. <i>Magd</i>, idem signante, addita
  term. <i>er</i> vel <i>der</i>, ut in proximo agro Lincolniensi in
  vocibus <i>Heeder</i> et <i>Sheeder</i> quæ Marem et Feminam notant.
  Author Dict. Angl. scribit <i>Modder</i>, et cum Kiliano deducit a Belg.
  <i>Modde</i>, <i>Moddeken</i>, Pupa, Puella,
  Virgincula."&mdash;<i>Etymol.</i> sub voce.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Webster merely gives (with strange neglect, having Skinner before
  him): <!-- Page 412 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page412"

<blockquote>
  <p>"Mauther, a foolish young girl(not used)."&mdash;<i>Ben
  Jonson.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Skinner is, I believe, wrong in assigning the <i>r</i> termination to
  the Danish word. Such a termination of the word <i>maid</i> is not to be
  found in any of the Teutonic dialects. The diphthong sound and the
  <i>th</i> appear frequently; as,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. Moeso-Gothic: <i>Magath</i> or <i>Magaths</i>; <i>Mawi</i>,</p>
      <p class="i4">dim. <i>Mawilo</i>.</p>
      <p>2. Anglo-Saxon: <i>Maeth</i>, <i>Maegth</i>, dim. <i>Meowla</i>.</p>
      <p>3. Old-German: <i>Maget</i>.</p>
      <p>4. Swedish: <i>Moe</i>.</p>
      <p>5. Norse: <i>Moei</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I therefore suppose the <i>r</i> termination in <i>mauther</i> to be a
  mere corruption, like that pointed out by Skinner in the Lincoln
  Folk-speech: or is it possible that it may have arisen from a contusion
  of the words <i>maid</i> and <i>mother</i> in Roman Catholic times? In
  Holland the Virgin Mary was called <i>Moeder Maagd</i>,&mdash;a phrase
  which may possibly have crossed over to the East Anglian coast, and
  occasioned the subsequent confusion.</p>

  moulded into the shape of a cat, bristles being inserted to represent the

  Minar's <i>Book of Antiquities</i>. But there still remains a chasm too
  wide for me to jump; inasmuch as Christopher Meiners published his

  Minar, died in 1464, being more than 300 years before.</p>

  <p><i>Croziers and Pastoral Staves</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 248,
  313.).&mdash;The opinion expressed by the REV. MR. WALCOT (in your No.
  50.), that by the word <i>crozier</i> is to be understood the crossed
  staff belonging only to archbishops and legates, while the staff with a
  crook at its end is to be called the pastoral staff, cannot, I think, be
  considered satisfactory, for the following, among other reasons.</p>

  <p>Crozier is generally (I should formerly have said universally)
  understood to mean the staff with a crook, the so well-known "ensign of
  bishops."</p>

  <p>In the instances mentioned by MR. WALCOT, <i>croziers</i> are
  repeatedly spoken of as having been borne at the funerals of
  <i>bishops</i>, while the crosses borne before Wolsey are called crosses,
  and not croziers.</p>

  <p>The word <i>crozier</i> seems to be derived from the mediæval Latin
  word <i>crocia</i>. This is explained by Ducange: "Pedum, baculus
  pastoralis, episcopalis." Crocia seems to be derived from, or closely
  connected with, "crocha, uncinus, lamus," and "crochum, uncus quo
  arcubalistæ tenduntur" (Ducange). Hence it appears that <i>crozier</i>
  does not refer to a cross but to a crook.</p>

  <p>In such ancient authorities as I have had the opportunity of referring
  to at the moment, as brasses, incised slabs, &amp;c., bishops and
  archbishops are alike represented with the crooked staff; a cross is of
  more rare occurrence, and at the moment only two instances occur to me,
  one in the fine brass of Frederic, son of Casimir, king of Poland, and a
  cardinal, which is in the cathedral of Cracow, and in which he is
  represented holding a crozier, while crosses are figured on the sides
  under the cardinal's hat. The other is in the curious brass of Lambert,
  bishop of Bamberg, in the cathedral of that city: in this the bishop
  holds a cross in his right and a crozier in his left hand.</p>

  <p>The statement that the crook of the bishop's staff was bent outwards,
  and that of the abbot's inward, is one which is often made in books; I
  should, however, be very glad to learn whether any difference has been
  observed to exist either in mediæval representations of croziers on
  seals, accompanying, effigies, or in paintings, or in the existing
  examples. So far as I have seen, the crook, in all except a few early
  instances, is bent in the same manner, <i>i.e.</i> inwards.</p>

  <p><i>Socinian Boast</i> (Vol. ii., p. 375.).&mdash;The following lines

  those quoted by Dr. Pusey:&mdash; <!-- Page 413 --><span

  <p>Przipcovius was a Polish knight, and cotempory the author of

  Butler to "crack the satiric thong:"</p>

  R. says that "<i>Sir William Grant</i>" was one of the few Scotchmen who
  had freed himself from the peculiarities of the speech of his country.
  Frank Horner is another." If R. means to include the <i>Scottish
  accent</i>, he is mistaken as to Sir William Grant, who retained a strong
  Scottish <i>burr</i>. If he means only correctness of diction, then I
  should say the number was not <i>few</i>. Mackintosh's and Jeffery's
  English was, I think, quite as pure as Horner's; and Lord Brougham, with
  much idiosyncrasy, had no <i>Scotch peculiarities</i>, at
  least&mdash;<i>me judice</i>&mdash;infinitely less than Sir William
  Grant. I could name twenty members of the present houses of parliament in
  whom I have never detected any "Scotch peculiarity."</p>

  by Von Hammer, your correspondent on the subject of Arabic numerals will
  find that these numerals were not invented as arbitrary signs, and
  borrowed for various alphabets; but that they are actually taken from an
  Indian alphabet of nine characters, the remaining letters being made up
  at each decimal by repeating the nine characters, with one or two dots.
  The English Preface states that this alphabet is still in use in India,
  not merely as a representative of numbers, but of letters of native

  alphabet occurs in page 7. of the Arabic original.</p>

  over by DR. RIMBAULT in his reprint of the work for the Percy Society in
  1842:</p>

  the queen, implying that the assertion was too strong; and, in fact, that

<blockquote>

  <p><i>Ale-draper</i> (Vol. ii., p.310.).&mdash;A common designation for
  an ale-house keeper in the sixteenth century. Henry Chettle, in his very
  curious little publication, <i>Kind-Harts Dreame</i>, 1592 (edited for
  the Percy Society by your humble servant), has the following passage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I came up to London, and fall to be some tapster, hostler, or
  chamberlaine in an inn. Well, I get mee a wife; with her a little money;
  when we are married, seeke a house we must; no other occupation have I
  but to be an <i>ale-draper</i>." (P. 37. of reprint.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again, in the same tract, the author speaks of "two milch maydens that
  had set up a shoppe of "<i>ale-drapery</i>."</p>

  <p>In the <i>Discoverie of the Knights of the Poste</i>, 1597, is another
  notice of the same occupation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"So that now hee hath left brokery, and is become a draper. A draper,
  quoth Freeman, what draper&mdash;of woollin or linnen? No, qd. he, an
  <i>ale-draper</i>, wherein he hath more skil then in the other."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Probably these instances of the use of the term may be sufficient for
  your correspondent.</p>

  <p class="author">EDWARD F. RIMBAULT.</p>

  <p>P.S. The above was written before J.S.W.'s note appeared (Vol. ii., p.
  360.), which does not carry the use of this term further back than
  Bailey's <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

  <p><i>George Herbert</i> (Vol. ii., p. 103.) was buried under the

  to his memory. It is painful to contrast the whitewash and unpainted deal
  of the house of God with the rich furniture and hangings of the adjoining
  rectory. In the garden of the latter is preserved a medlar-tree, planted
  by "the sweet singer of the temple."</p>

  <p><i>Notaries Public</i> (Vol. ii., p. 393.).&mdash;Why does your
  correspondent MANLEIUS think this form of expression "putting the cart
  before the horse?" <i>Public notary</i> (though that phrase is sometimes
  erroneously used) is not so exact as "notary public;" for a notary is
  not, as the first form would imply, a public officer appointed by the
  public to perform public services, but an individual agent through whose
  ministry private acts or instruments become <i>publici juris</i>. The
  same form, and for analogous reasons, prevails in several other legal and
  technical titles or phrases, as Attorney-General, Solicitor-General,
  Accountant-General, Receiver-General, Surveyor-General; Advocate Fiscal;
  Theatre Royal, Chapel Royal; Gazette Extraordinary; and many other
  phrases in which it is evident that the adjective has a special and
  restricted meaning.</p>

  <p><i>Tobacconists</i> (Vol. ii, p. 393.).&mdash;There was, in the old
  house of commons, a room called the <i>smoking-room</i>, where members
  tired of the debate used to retire to smoke, and in later years to drink
  tea or write letters. These, no doubt, were meant by the
  <i>Tobacconists</i>, members within call, though not actually within the
  house.</p>

  formerly belonged to the Abbey of Bath.</p>

  <p>There is also in the suburbs, on the north side of the city of Bath, a

  <p>Those who know Mr. Craik's happy tact for seizing on the more striking

  history and biography, his love of research, and perseverance in
  following up a clue, were prepared to expect both instruction and
  amusement from his <i>Romance of the Peerage</i>. Nor were they doomed to
  disappointment. Each succeeding volume has added to the interest of the
  work and there can be little doubt, that the favour with which the first

  great completeness the history of Anne Clifford, the most remarkable
  woman of her time; that he furnishes pleasant gossipping pictures of the
  rise of the families of Fox, Phips, and Petty; the history of the
  celebrated claim of the Trunkmaker to the honours of the
  Percies,&mdash;of the story of the heiress of the Percies who married Tom
  Thynn of Longleat Hall; and lastly, that of Ann of Buccleugh, <!-- Page

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
